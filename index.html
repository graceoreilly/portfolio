            My name is Grace. I am from Ireland and love going home to visit my family.
            I worked as an Occupational Therapist in London for the last five years, but
            I never felt like healthcare was right for me. About a year ago, I decided
            to explore other career paths and dive into technology.
          </p>
          <p class="about_me_text">
            In November 2024, I was thrilled to be accepted into the School of Code Bootcamp.
            This intensive program has allowed me to deepen my skills as a full stack developer,
            and I’m excited to apply my knowledge to create new and exciting projects.
